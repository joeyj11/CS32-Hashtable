# CS32-Hashtable
C++ Hashtable Implementation

## Summary
This hashtable implementation uses a Node structure in C++11 to implement the unordered_map library through code. The implementation comes with all the standard functions that an unordered_map has.

## Technologies
```
∙ C++
∙ Hashtables, Classes, Vectors, Structs
∙ Recursion / Dynamic Programming
∙ Inheritance & Abstraction
```

## Role
This was an assignment at UCLA in my data structures / algorithms class, and thus the project was completely up to me to implement.

## Resources
This project was designed in C++11 using standard data structures for CS32 at UCLA.
